# Odyssey

### Project Overview
Odyssey was a React Native app project we worked on during a hackathon. I was first exposed to React Native and Android Development during this time. Regarding the project, Odyssey is a **digital travel companion** that integrates an **Android app** with an **IoT-based Information System**. The platform enables travelers to access location-specific insights and share experiences in real time.

### Implementation
Odyssey was developed with the following technologies:
- **React Native**: Mobile development framework for an intuitive user interface.
- **ESP32 Microcontrollers**: Low-cost, WiFi-enabled devices serving as information beacons in travel locations.
- **WiFi Communication**: Facilitating real-time data exchange between devices and users.

### Project Setup
To explore or extend Odyssey, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed
- Expo CLI for running the mobile application
- ESP32 development environment

#### Running the Mobile Application:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mukesharyal/Odyssey.git
   cd Odyssey
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npx react-native run-android
   npx react-native start
   ```

#### Setting Up ESP32 Devices:
1. Flash firmware using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
2. Configure WiFi settings for connectivity.
3. Deploy the ESP32 devices in designated travel locations.

### Results:
While our team was not able to win any prizes, this was the project that got me interested in React Native and Android development.
