# 🌍 Odyssey – A Digital Travel Companion

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Odyssey** is a React Native app developed during a hackathon that marked my first dive into **React Native** and **Android Development**. The app serves as a **digital travel companion**, integrating an intuitive mobile application with an **IoT-based information system**. It allows travelers to access **location-specific insights** and **share experiences** in real time.
